    "This morning, we will work through the process of developing functions and moving them into `.py` files. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why does this matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "As data scientists, it is not only important that our analysis is strong, it is also *very* important that our work can be understood. Typically, we write a lot of code when working on data science projects, and much of the code is not \"required reading\" for following the narrative of how we came to our results. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, visualization code can be messy and is rarely helpful for someone reading our reports. The output of that code is what matters! For this reason, it is oftentimes best to move our code into separate files and import it into our final notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Of course, transparency is important! Whenever possible, you should link to the files containing custom code so readers can examine the code if they  wish to!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Please note:*** This process is usually only done once a project has been completed, when the findings have been finalized, and the final report is being written. "
